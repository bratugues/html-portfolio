<h2>My Top 3 movies of all-time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>ELVIS (2022)</h3>
<p>I am a big fan of Elvis Presley, so this movie that tells his story was something that I wanted to see for a long time. The actors were great, the production was amazing, and the soundtrack was incredible.</p>

<h3>Percy Jackson</h3>
<p>I remember watching this movie many times when I was young. In general, I have not watched many of those famous fantasy movies, but for some reason this one was awesome for me and I watched it many times. Fun Fact: I never watched the second movie of the series.</p>

<h3>Monsters Inc.</h3>
<p>This cartoon from Pixar have always been one of my favorite movies of all-time. I really like the concept of the city that gets energy from the children's screams, it is very creative. What I liked the most though was the doors. You open a door and you are in a complete different location. I also enjoyed seeing all the different monsters and the roles they played inside the "fear factory".</p>
