<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I am Erick :D
 <br/> It's a pleasure to meet you!

</p>

<p>I am currently 24 years old, I come from Brazil and I recently graduated in International Business Administration at Feng Chia University, in Taiwan.
  <br/> I have one year experience as an International Business Development representative working in a company in Taiwan, which gave me a good experience and made me learn both technical skills and especially soft skills that are valuable in any field.
</p>

<p>Now, I returned to Brazil (and will be moving to Europe really soon), where I fell in love with coding and realized I wanted to become a Web Developer. 
  <br/> And here I am! With the teachings that my sales experience gave me, with the knowledge from my degree (that certainly helps indirectly in this field) and my experience with my Web Development projects, I am sure we can work together and achieve great things!
